# Docs
This document describes the main vision of this project. It is to be followed and feature changes should also be noted here.

## Goal
The goal is a note keeper similar to OneNote but open source and extendable like VS Code.
1. The application should be free and open source and should support multiple devices (Windows, Linux, IOS, ...).
2. Plugins will be written in Lua, are asynchronous and should have as much functionality as possible.
3. Speed should be top priority so that battery powered devices won't discharge as fast.
